It's only when I hear the sounds of shuffling feet and supplies being put away that I realize that the lecture's over. 1 
Professor Eileen's lectures are usually interesting, but today I just couldn't concentrate on it. 2 
I've had a lot of other thoughts on my mind...thoughts that culminate in a question. 3 
It's a question that I've been meaning to ask a certain someone. 4 
When we come out of the university, I spot her right away. 5 
I've known Sylvie since we were kids. She's got a big heart and she's always been a good friend to me. 6 
But recently... I've felt that I want something more. 7 
More than just talking, more than just walking home together when our classes end. 8 
As soon as she catches my eye, I ask myself: do I want to ask her right away. 9 
 10.y.s "Hi there!" 10.y 
 10.n.s goto 105 10.n 
"How was class?" 11 
"Good..." 12 
I can't bring myself to admit that it all went in one ear and out the other. 13 
"Are you going home now? Wanna walk back with me?" 14 
"Sure!" 15 
After a short while, we reach the meadows just outside the neighborhood where we both live. 16 
It's a scenic view I've grown used to. Autumn is especially beautiful here. 17 
When we were children, we played in these meadows a lot, so they're full of memories. 18 
"Hey... Umm..." 19 
She turns to me and smiles. She looks so welcoming that I feel my nervousness melt away. 20 
I'll ask her...! 21 
"Ummm... Will you..." 22 
"Will you be my artist for a visual novel?" 23 
Silence. 24 
She looks so shocked that I begin to fear the worst. But then... 25 
"Sure, but what's a "visual novel?", Is that like a game?" 26 

 105.s I can't get up the nerve to ask right now. With a gulp, I decide to ask her later. 105 
But I'm an indecisive person. 106 
I couldn't ask her that day and I end up never being able to ask her. 107 
I guess I'll never know the answer to my question now... 108
